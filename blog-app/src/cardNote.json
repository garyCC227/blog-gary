            "content": "### What is RESTful??\n***\n***REST(Representational State Transfer)***, is an architectureal style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other. The following are the major features of RESTful.\n##### 1. Stateless\nSystems that follow the REST paradigm are stateless, meaning that the server doesn't need to know the state of the client, or vice versa. The only important thing is the resource. In this way, the client and server can understand any message received, event without seeing previous state.\n\n##### 2. Separation of Client and Server\nBy separating the user interface concerns from the data storage concerns, we improve the portability of the user interface across multiple platforms and improve scalability by simplifying the server components. We need to consider this when we develope the design. One good implementation is -> You can always add columns (fields) to a database table. But don\u2019t take one away. The principle in RESTful services is the same.\n\n##### 3. Cacheable\nCache constraints require that the data within a response to a request be implicitly or explicitly labeled as cacheable or non-cacheable. If a response is cacheable, then a client cache is given the right to reuse that response data for later, equivalent requests.\n\n##### 4. Uniform interface\nThe interface need to be uniform that can allow independent evolution of the application without having other side effect. such as using HTTP with URL resources, CURD and JSON for client to use.\n##### 5. Layered System\nAs the name implies, the RESTful system is comprised of layers, each layer has its own specific functionality and responsibility. e.g. MVC framework \n\n#### Resource(response) in RESTful API \nThe most significant thing in RESTful is resource. The state of the resource at any particular timestamp is known as resource representation. A representation consists of data, metadata describing the data and hypermedia links which can help the clients in transition to the next desired state. such as using HATEOAS package to format the resource as [HAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Application_Language) style.\n\n### RESTful API with Spring\n***\n***How to use Spring to build RESTful API***\nIn Spring, we use the web MVC framework to wrap RESTful application into web layer, and use MVC architecture to handle the incoming request and return resource to client.\n\n![RESTful-flow char](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garyCC227/blog-gary/gary/blog-app/src/content/RESTful.png)\n\nThere are 3 major componenets in MVC framework. \nThe first Component is **Dispatcher Servlet**, there are two tasks in dispathcer servlet.\n>1.  recieving incoming request, and map it to the specific controller;\n>2. the response to Client.\n\nThe 2nd component is  called **Controller**, there are also 2 tasks in the controller; \n>1. Action Mapping, which is  mapping the incoming URL endpoints with the HTTP method to get the specific resource with 3rd Component Model. So, The HTTP method are the 4 standard one, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, which is included in the incoming request. \n>2. Return the recieved resource to the dispatcher servlet, then return to the Client. But normally in this task, we woulid like to format the resource with a better respentation before returning it, to make our application more RESTful. So one of the package in Spring call HATEOAS, we can use this package to format the resource with the HAL style to remove some side effect, so it can make our application more RESTful. \n\nthe 3rd component is **Model**, \n> 1. its task is to get the specific resource for the request, and return it to controller. in order to get the resource,  we use a thing call JPA repository. each JPA repository manage one domain object, and has CRUD method(which is create,...) and query execution and pagination method to interact with the database to get the resource.\n\n***Flow Process***\n1. HTTP request send to dispatcher servlet, DS forward the request to handler mapping\n2. handler mapping map the  request to specific Contoller\n3. Contoller does action mapping with the URL endpoints and actions to know what resource it want, and then ask Model to get it\n4. In Model, it use repository method to interact with databse to get the resource, and return resource to controller\n5. Controller format the resource with a good representional style, one of the style is HAL. which can be implemented by Spring HATEOAS package.\n6. return the resourece as response to client \n\n### JPA Repository \n***\n- Spring Data JPA repositories are interfaces with methods supporting creating, reading, updating, and deleting records against a back end data store\n - The JpaRepository is subclass of CRUD and PagingAndSort([JAVA repository solution](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories)). As you might guess from its name, the CrudRepository interface defines a repository that offers standard create, read, update and delete operations. The PagingAndSortingRepository extends the CrudRepository and adds findAll methods that enable you to sort the result and to retrieve it in a paginated way. Both interface are also supported by other Spring Data projects, so that you can apply the same concepts to different datastores. The JpaRepository adds JPA-specific methods, like flush() to trigger a flush on the persistence context or findAll(Example<S> example) to find entities by example, to the PagingAndSortingRepository. \n \n***\n##### My Simple RESTful API implementation with Spring framework\n[Github Repository](https://github.com/garyCC227/RESTful_simple)\n\n\n\n##### More things are coming\n***gradle and pom***\n\n\n\n \n"

            "content": "\r\nAn API key or application programming interface key is a code that gets passed in by computer applications. The program or application then calls the API to identify its user, developer or calling program to a website.\r\n\r\nApplication programming keys are normally used to assist in tracking and controlling how the interface is being utilized. Often, it does this to prevent abuse or malicious use of the API in question.\r\n\r\nAn API key is both incredibly powerful and extremely vulnerable. API key exposure can result in significant damage, both to a company and to the data it holds. As such, hiding and securing keys (as well as a mitigating potential loss) is critical for any security plan in the modern API space.\r\n\r\n**So, how do we hide it in React? Here is how to do it in a React app:**\r\n\r\n**1. Create a file called `.env` in the root of your project\u2019s directory.**\r\n\r\n```\r\nnode_modules\r\npublic\r\nsrc\r\n.env     <---- Here\r\n.gitignore\r\nLICENSE\r\nREADME.md\r\npackage-lock.json\r\npackage.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n**2. Inside the `.env` file, prepend `REACT_APP_` to your API key name of choice and assign it.**\r\n\r\n`REACT_APP_` is, in fact, a tool that create-react-app uses to identify these variables.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// .env\r\nAPI_KEY=your_api_key            <-- this won't work\r\nREACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key  <-- yes! this work\r\n// Example:\r\n// REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY=123456\r\n```\r\n\r\n**3. Add the `.env` file to your `.gitignore` file.**\r\n\r\nYou don\u2019t want this file to be committed to gitHub!\r\n\r\n```\r\n// .gitignore\r\n\r\n# api keys\r\n.env       <-- add this line\r\n\r\n# dependencies\r\n/node_modules\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you\u2019ve saved `.gitignore`, run `$git status` to make sure that `.env` is not on the list of changes to be committed.\r\n\r\n**4. Access the API key via the `process.env` object.**\r\n\r\nTo check that you can access your API key, go to your `App.js` file and add `console.log` at the top below the require statements. After saving the file and reloading the page, if the `console log` does not show your API key, try restarting the react server. And of course, make sure to remove the `console.log` line before committing your code.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// src/App.js\r\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\r\nimport './App.css';\r\nconsole.log(process.env.REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY)\r\nclass App extends Component {\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n> The accidental synchronization of secure code is not uncommon. The solutions to hide is very easy to implement and can be done broadly across almost any current implementation. Ensuring the security of your API key should be a major focus for any organization or personal project, and is a first major step for any security plan. What do you think about this implementation?\r\n"

            "content": "\r\nGit is a version control system that is primarily used for source-code management in software development. It is designed to handle all kinds of small and big types of projects. Using git we can keep a track of changes in any set of files among multiple people and with its help we can work offline.\r\n\r\n**Why I use git**\r\n\r\nBeing a learner and a front-end web developer a lot of time I tend to work on local development sites then just upload everything when I am done coding. This is fine when I work on a small project or for practice purposes. But when I have to deal with lots of complicated projects with a different team member that is simply not feasible. That\u2019s when I turn to something called git.\r\n\r\nGit allows me to have a \u201cversion\u201d of a project which shows the changes that were made to the code over time, and allows me to backtrack if necessary and undo the changes. This ability alone of being able to compare two versions of the code or reverse changes, make it fairly invaluable when working on a larger project.\r\n\r\nUsing git operation, I can control the version of any big and small project and handle it in a short period of time. Some of the basic operations of git are:\r\n\r\n- Init\r\n- Add\r\n- Commit\r\n- Pull\r\n- Push\r\n- Branch\r\n- Merge\r\n- Rebase\r\n\r\nThese are some basic operations used on a daily basis, all of the operations require to have an origin, also known as repo or repository. A Git Repository is a virtual storage of your project. It allows you to save a version of your code which can be accessed when needed.\r\n\r\n**Initialize**\r\n\r\nIn order to initialize we use the \u201cgit init\u201d command. This command creates a new git repository or no-initializes an exiting one. It is used to convert an existing, non-versioned project to a git repository or initialize a new, empty repository. It basically creates a \u201c.git\u201d directory with subdirectories and template files.\r\n\r\n**Add**\r\n\r\nThis command updates the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit. Thus, after making changes to the working tree, and before running the commit command we must use \u201cgit add <filename>\u201d command to add any new or modified files to the index. With this command, we also need the git status command to obtain the summary of the working directory and the staging area.\r\n\r\n**Commit**\r\n\r\nThis command is used to store the current contents of the index in the new commit. In git, a commit adds the latest changes to the source code to the repository, making these changes part of the head revision of the repository. Some important options of git commit are:\r\n\r\n- -m:- It sets the commit message.\r\n- -a:- It includes all the currently changed files in the commit.\r\n- --amend:- It rewrites the very last commit with any currently staged changes and/or a new commit message.\r\n\r\n**Pull**\r\n\r\nThe \u201cpull\u201d command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match the content. The git pull command is actually a combination of two other commands, git fetch followed by git merge. In the first stage of operation, git pull will execute a git fetch scoped to the local branch that HEAD is printed at. Once the content is downloaded, git pull will enter a merge workflow. A new merge commit will be created and HEAD updated to point at the new commit.\r\n\r\n**Push**\r\n\r\nThe \u201cpush\u201d command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repository. It\u2019s the counterpart to the git fetch, but whereas fetching imports commits to a local branch, pushing exports commits to the remote branches. Remote branches are configured using the git remote command. Pushing has the potential to overwrite changes, caution should be taken when pushing.\r\n\r\n**Branching**\r\n\r\nBranching means you diverge from the mainline of development and continue to do work without messing with that mainline. In git, branching is a part of your everyday development process. Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix bug, matter how big or how small you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes.\r\nThe git branch command lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches. It doesn\u2019t let you switch between branches or put a forked history back together again.\r\n\r\n**Merging**\r\n\r\nMerging is a git way of putting a forked history back together again. The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by the git branch and integrate them into a single branch. Git merge will combine multiple sequences of commit into one unified history. In the most frequent use cases, git merge is used to combine two branches.\r\n\r\n**Rebasing**\r\n\r\nRebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commit to a new base commit. Rebasing is most useful and easily visualized in the context of a feature branching workflow.\r\n\r\n\\***\\*Version Control Hosting Software\\*\\***\r\n\r\nVersion control hosting solution are a product that host multiple code repository in the cloud and integrate with and often provide online tools that enhance the use of version control system. Version control hosting solutions allows developers who collaborate on the source code to manage a master repository in which they can commit their code changes and pull down the new code to their local computer. Some of the version control hosting software are:-\r\n\r\n- GitHub\r\n- GitLab\r\n- Bitbucket\r\n- JFrog\r\n- Assembla\r\n- Beanstalk\r\n\r\n> ### HappyCoding \ud83d\ude80\r\n"

            "content": "\r\nBeing a JavaScript developer we have to deal with **_Asynchronous code_**, especially, when your application has too much of I/O in it. To deal with asynchronous code,**_callbacks_** &**_promises_** makes their way into the picture. Promises turn out to be more promising for making the code behave synchronously. In this article, we try to understand **_why to use JavaScript promises._**\r\n\r\n**What is Promises?**\r\n\r\nA promise is an object that may produce a single value sometime in the future: either a resolved value or a reason that it\u2019s not resolved (e.g., a network error occurred). A promise may be in one of 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending. Promise users can attach callbacks to handle the fulfilled value or the reason for rejection.\r\nPromises are eager, meaning that a promise will start doing whatever task you give it as soon as the promise constructor is invoked.\r\n\r\n**How JavaScript Promises Work**\r\n\r\nJavaScript Promises work in one of 3 below possible states.\r\n\r\n- _pending:_ initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.\r\n\r\n- _fulfilled:_ meaning that the operation completed successfully.\r\n\r\n- _rejected:_ meaning that the operation failed.\r\n\r\n**Why use promises?**\r\n\r\nBefore we use promises, our code was full of confusing callback tricks and asynchronous. Switching to promises made our code easier to read, understand, and test. There are so many reasons to use promises, but here is some reason to use them.\r\n\r\n**1) Ease of Use**\r\n\r\nJavaScript promises make our code look so clean and they are easy to learn, understand, and debug.\r\n\r\n**2) Handling errors**\r\n\r\nWhen anything in the chain of promises fails and raises an error or rejects the promise, the control goes to the nearest catch() statement down the chain.\r\n\r\n```code\r\nnew Promise((resolve, reject) => {\r\n  reject('Error')\r\n}).catch(err => {\r\n  console.error(err)\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n**3) Cascade errors handling**\r\n\r\nIf inside the catch() you raise an error, you can append a second catch() to handle it, and so on.\r\n\r\n```code\r\nnew Promise((resolve, reject) => {\r\n  throw new Error('Error')\r\n})\r\n  .catch(err => {\r\n    throw new Error('Error')\r\n  })\r\n  .catch(err => {\r\n    console.error(err)\r\n  })\r\n```\r\n\r\n**4) Chaining promises**\r\n\r\nA promise can be returned to another promise, creating a chain of promises.\r\n\r\nA great example of chaining promises is given by the Fetch API, a layer on top of the XMLHttpRequest API, which we can use to get a resource and queue a chain of promises to execute when the resource is fetched.\r\n\r\n```code\r\nconst status = response => {\r\n  if (response.status >= 200 && response.status < 300) {\r\n    return Promise.resolve(response)\r\n  }\r\n  return Promise.reject(new Error(response.statusText))\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst json = response => response.json()\r\n\r\nfetch('/todos.json')\r\n  .then(status)\r\n  .then(json)\r\n  .then(data => {\r\n    console.log('Request succeeded with JSON response', data)\r\n  })\r\n  .catch(error => {\r\n    console.log('Request failed', error)\r\n  })\r\n```\r\n"

Moreover, other developers mock you when they are trying to find what all is happening in your code.\r\n\r\nSo here I have mentioned how we can write better and clean code so that other developers can better understand it. Here I have given a quick introduction to certain techniques I use while writing codes, and show you how you can do the same.\r\n\r\n**1) Plan it out\u2063**\r\n\r\nBefore beginning to code, plan out your projects. Write down everything you\u2019ll need, break it down into steps.\u2063\r\n\r\nThis will result in better code and will increase your workflow.\u2063\r\n\r\n**2) Use Comments\u2063**\r\n\r\nCommenting your code will not only help you but will help other people working with your code.\u2063\r\n\r\nGood comments explain why things are done, not what is done. The code itself explains what is done.\u2063\r\n\r\n**3) D.R.Y\u2063**\r\n\r\nD.R.Y stands for: Don\u2019t Repeat Yourself. Always make sure your code is D.R.Y when possible by re-using variables, functions, etc.\u2063\r\n\r\n**4) Naming\u2063**\r\n\r\nMake your names for classes, variables, methods, functions, and so on, descriptive and unique.\u2063\r\n\r\nThis helps everyone understand what is happening and makes it easier to support.\u2063\r\n\r\n**5) Avoid Long Nesting\u2063**\r\n\r\nToo many levels make code harder to read and follow, so don\u2019t have a while loop inside an if inside an else, inside a for loop, inside an else if, inside a do/while loop, inside\u2026well, you see where we\u2019re going with this.\u2063\r\n\r\n**6) Test Your Code\u2063**\r\n\r\nBefore releasing your product, make sure you have fully tested your code for bugs and errors.\u2063\r\n\r\nThere are many tools you can use to automate this process too!\u2063\r\n\r\n**7) Version Control\u2063**\r\n\r\nUsing version control software helps you keep track of changes and keep every team member working off the latest version. \u2063\r\n\r\n**\u20638) Document Your Code\u2063**\r\n\r\nDocumenting your code is just as important as all the others. If you want people to follow your conventions and understand how your product works, you need good documentation.\r\n\r\n> Note: \u2063In this article, I shared my experience to write a clean and better code which is very essential for every developer who wants to be remarkable in the career path.\r\n"

Default dict methods\n\n|Method  |Description  |\n|:------:|:-------------|\n`clear()`|\tRemoves all the elements from the dictionary\n`copy()`\t|Returns a copy of the dictionary\n`fromkeys()`\t|Returns a dictionary with the specified keys and value |\n`get(key[,default])`\t|Returns the value of the specified key, if default is not given, it defaults to `None`\n`items()`\t|Returns a list containing a tuple for each key value pair\n`keys()`\t|Returns a list containing the dictionary's keys\n`pop(key[, default])`\t|Removes the element with the specified key\n`popitem()`\t|Removes the last inserted key-value pair\n`setdefault(key[,default])`\t|Returns the value of the specified key. If the key does not exist: insert the key, with the specified value\n`update([other])`\t|Updates the dictionary with the specified key-value pairs;update() accepts either another dictionary object or an iterable of key/value pairs (as tuples or other iterables of length two). If keyword arguments are specified, the dictionary is then updated with those key/value pairs: d.update(red=1, blue=2)\n`values()`\t|Returns a list of all the values in the dictionary\n`list(d)`|return a list of all the keys\n`len(d)`| return the number of items in the dictionary\n`key in d` | return `True` if *d* has a key *key*, else `False` \n`iter(d)` | == `iter(d.keys())`\n`reversed(d)` | == `reversed(d.keys())` : iterator of the keys\n\n\n>- **dict.fromkeys()**\n>>```Python\n>>x = ('key1', 'key2', 'key3')\n>>dict.fromkeys(x)\n>>#{'key1': None, 'key2': None, 'key3': None}\n>>```\n\n>- **`|` Union**(python 3.9). If a key appears in both operands, the last-seen value (i.e. that from the right-hand operand) wins \n>>```Python\n>>> d = {'spam': 1, 'eggs': 2, 'cheese': 3}\n>>> e = {'cheese': 'cheddar', 'aardvark': 'Ethel'}\n>>> d | e\n>>{'spam': 1, 'eggs': 2, 'cheese': 'cheddar', 'aardvark': 'Ethel'}\n>>> e | d\n>>{'cheese': 3, 'aardvark': 'Ethel', 'spam': 1, 'eggs': 2}\n>>```\n\n- `|=`(python 3.9)\n```Python\n>>> d |= e\n>>> d\n{'spam': 1, 'eggs': 2, 'cheese': 'cheddar', 'aardvark': 'Ethel'}\n```\n\n# 2. Collections - Table of Contents \nWill talk about the following collections\n- Counter\n- defaultDict\n- OrderedDict\n- \n## 3. Counter\n#### 3.1 Definition:\nA `Counter` is a `dict` subclass for counting hashable objects. key as element, value as counts.\nCounts are allowed to be any integer value including zero or negative counts.\n\n#### 3.2 Initialization 1\n> ```Python\n>c = Counter('gallahad')                # a new counter from an iterable\n>#Counter({'g': 1, 'a': 3, 'l': 2, 'h': 1, 'd': 1})\n>c = Counter({'red': 4, 'blue': 2})     # a new counter from a mapping\n># c: Counter({'red': 4, 'blue': 2})\n>c = Counter(cats=4, dogs=8)            # a new counter from keyword args\n># c: Counter({'cats': 4, 'dogs': 8})\n>```\n\n#### 3.3 Initialization 2\n>```Python\n>c = Counter(['eggs', 'ham'])\n>c['bacon']                              # count of a missing element is zero\n># 0\n>```\n\n#### 3.4 deletion:\n>Setting a count to zero does not remove an element from a counter. Use del to remove it entirely:\n>```Python\n>c['sausage'] = 0                        # counter entry with a zero count\n>del c['sausage]\n>```\n\n####  3.5 methods\n- `elements()`\n>```Python\n>c = Counter(a=4, b=2, c=0, d=-2)\n>sorted(c.elements())\n>#['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'b']\n>```\n\n- `most_common([n])` : return a list of the n most common elements and their counts from the most common to the least, if *n* is ommitted or `None`, it will return all elements\n>```Python\n>Counter('aaabbcc').most_common(2)\n>#[('a', 3), ('b', 2)]\n>```\n\n- `subtract()`\n>```Python\n>a = Counter('aaabbcc')\n>b = Counter('abc')\n>a.subtract(b)\n> #Counter({'a': 2, 'b': 1, 'c': 1})\n>```\n\n- `fromkeys(iterable)` not implemented\n- `update(iterable-or-mapping)` like `dict.update()`, add counts instead of replacing them; Also expect to be a sequence of elements, not a sequence of `(key, value)` paris.\n- Unary addition and subtraction are shortcuts for adding an empty counter or subtracting from an empty counter.\n```Python\nc = Counter(a=2, b=-4)\n+c\n#Counter({'a': 2})\n-c\n#Counter({'b': 4})\n```\n\n##### Note: Only use `Counter` for postive counts\n\n![Counter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garycc227/blog-img/main/py-collection/counter.PNG)\n## 4. defaultdict\n\n#### 4.1 definition\n`defaultdict([default_factory])` is a subclass of the built-in `dict` class. It overrides one method and adds one writable instance variable. The remaining functionality is the same as for the `dict` class.\n\nThe first argument provides the initial value for the `default_factory` attribute; it defaults to `None`. All remaining arguments are treated the same as if they were passed to the `dict` constructor, including keyword arguments.\n\n\n#### 4.2 default_factory\n`defaultdict` is similar to `dict`, but it has `default_factory` to set the default value for key;\n`defaultdict` has to be a `func`\n\n![Counter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garycc227/blog-img/main/py-collection/defaultdict.PNG)\n## 5.OrderedDict([items])\n\n##### 5.1 definition \n`dict` with specific order, LIFO(`last=True`) or FIFO for `popitem` and `move_to_end`\n\n##### 5.2 method\n- `popitem(last=True)` \n- `move_to_end(key, last=True)`\n```Python \nd = OrderedDict.fromkeys('abcd')\nd.move_to_end('a')\n''.join(d.keys()) #bcda\n\nd.move_to_end('a', last=False)\n''.join(d.keys()) #abcd\n```\n\n- support `reversed`\n- support `|` merge and `|=` update\n![ordereddict](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garycc227/blog-img/main/py-collection/ordereddict.PNG)\n"
